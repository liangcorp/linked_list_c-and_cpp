# Linked List Written in C
Implementation of single and doubly linked list in C.

Union was used as the content for each node in the linked list. The union contains int, float and char.

## Single Linked List
Functions for single linked list are the following:
- add_first()
- add_last()
- add_at
- remove_first()
- remove_last()
- remove_at()
- length_of()
- display()
- sort_aes()
- sort_des()
- free_memory() needs to be called before exiting the program.

## Doubly Linked List
Functions for doubly linked list are the following:
- add_first()
- add_end()
- add_at()
- remove_first()
- remove_last()
- remove_at()
- sort_aes()
- sort_des()
- display()
- display_reverse()
- length_of()
- free_memory() needs to be called before exiting the program.
